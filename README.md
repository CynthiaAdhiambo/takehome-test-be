# Take Home Test for Junior SWE

In-person coding interviews can be stressful, and can hide some people's full potential. A take-home test gives you the chance showcase your talent by working in your own space, and on your own time.

We understand you may have time constraints, so we've made this as simple as possible to evaluate the skill and tech stack you will be using in your day-to-day here at Namiri.

## The Task

Your mission will be to build a web API that can be used to play a Futurama Trivia game. It's possible to get the list of questions from [Sample API's Futurama questions endpoint](https://api.sampleapis.com/futurama/questions). The API will need to support the following features:

- A game session will have 3 questions
- Present the question its list of possible answers
- The player will be able to select one answer
- The player will be able to see if their answer was correct or incorrect
- The player will be able to see their score at the end of the game

Feel free to use Javascript or Typescript to build the API. You can use any database you like, but we recommend using PostgreSQL. Use npm modules as you see fit, you do not have to reinvent the wheel if you can avoid it. Remember to take notes in the [notes section](#your-notes).

## Evaluation criteria

We will use this project as the basis for evaluating your skill as a developer.

While we'll be gathering as much data as we can from your implementation, our evaluation will focus on these core concepts:

- Solution Integrity: Is your solution complete and functional?
- Design: What choices did you make in regards to functionality, readability, maintainability, extendability, and did you make appropriate use of language/framework features?
- Testability: Have you considered how you'd test your code?
- Documentation: Have you provided context for decisions and assumptions that you've made?

## Your Notes

_TODO: Please leave us any notes about your experience with this challenge here._

## Time Spent

_TODO: Give us a rough estimate of the time you spent working on the test. If you spent time learning in order to do this project please feel free to let us know that too. This makes sure that we are evaluating your work fairly and in context. It also gives us the opportunity to learn and adjust our process if needed._

## Assumptions

_TODO: Did you find yourself needing to make assumptions to complete this? If so, what were they, and how did they impact your design/code?_

## Production Readiness

_TODO: Provide us with some notes about what you would do next if you had more time. Are there additional features that you would want to add? Specific improvements to the code you would make? Any additional testing or documentation?_
